Before you can run all the labs about containers in IBM Cloud Private, you should prepare your environment to execute those labs. Check the following instructions [Lab 0](Lab%200/README.md)


# Task 1. Install Docker Desktop on your Mac

Follow this procedure to install the latest Docker Desktop (ex Community Edition) on your Mac (**for Windows**, jump to the next session) 

Docker Desktop for Mac is favailable for free.

https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac

![image-20190118113648920](images/image-20190118113648920-7807808.png)

Click on the blue button **Please Login to Download**. If you are not registred to the Docker site, then create an account. Then when you are registered and logged in, click on the **Get Docker ** button.

![image-20190118113959736](images/image-20190118113959736-7807999.png)

Double-click **Docker.dmg** to start the install process.

When the installation completes and Docker starts, the whale in the top status bar shows that Docker is running, and accessible from a terminal.

![Docker for Mac is ready](./images/install2docker.png)

Open a terminal and type :

`docker version`

You should see something similar to this screen :
```console
> docker version
Client: Docker Engine - Community
 Version:           18.09.1
 API version:       1.39
 Go version:        go1.10.6
 Git commit:        4c52b90
 Built:             Wed Jan  9 19:33:12 2019
 OS/Arch:           darwin/amd64
 Experimental:      false

Server: Docker Engine - Community
 Engine:
  Version:          18.09.1
  API version:      1.39 (minimum version 1.12)
  Go version:       go1.10.6
  Git commit:       4c52b90
  Built:            Wed Jan  9 19:41:49 2019
  OS/Arch:          linux/amd64
  Experimental:     true

```
> Note that you should always have the client and the server running.

> The Docker server contains the **Docker engine**(containerd) that controls running containers. 


# Task 2. Install Docker Desktop on Windows

Follow this procedure to install the latest Docker Desktop (ex Community Edition) on Windows (for Mac, jump to the previous session) 

Docker Desktop for Windows is available for free.

https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows

![image-20190118115800766](images/image-20190118115800766-7809080.png)

Click on the blue button **Please Login to Download**. If you are **not** registred to the Docker site, then create an account. Then when you are registered and logged in, click on the **Get Docker ** button.

![image-20190118114556568](images/image-20190118114556568-7808356.png)

Leave the default parameters: 

![Docker for Windows](./images/dockerwindows2.png)

After download, install Docker Desktop:

**Double-click Docker for Windows Installer** to run the installer.

> **IMPORTANT**: During the installation process, you may be informed the installer will reboot your workstation to install the virtualization feature of your PC. 


When the installation finishes, Docker starts automatically. The **whale** in the notification area indicates that Docker is running, and accessible from a terminal.

Open a command-line terminal like PowerShell, and try out some Docker commands!

Run docker version to check the version.

`docker version`

You should see something similar to this screen :
```console
> docker version
Client: Docker Engine - Community
 Version:           18.09.1
 API version:       1.39
 Go version:        go1.10.6
 Git commit:        4c52b90
 Built:             Wed Jan  9 19:33:12 2019
 OS/Arch:           darwin/amd64

  Experimental:     true
```

# Task 5. Install Git on your laptop

To do so : 

For MacOS :
http://mac.github.com

For Windows: 
http://git-scm.com/download/win

At some point during the installation, change to the **"Use Windows default console"** and continue the installation.

# Task 6. Install the ibmcloud commands

The **ibmcloud** command line interface (CLI) provides a set of commands that are grouped by namespace for users to interact with IBM Cloud. In previous versions, the name of that command was "bluemix" or "bx".

You install a set of IBM Cloud commands and tools, verify the installation, and configure your environment. IBMÂ® Cloud developer tools offer a command-line approach to creating, developing, and deploying end-to-end web, mobile, and microservice applications.

For MacOS or Linux (run as root) :
`curl -sL https://ibm.biz/idt-installer | bash`

For Windows in PowerShell (run as Administrator - your system will be rebooted at the end of installation) : 

```
Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted; iex(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://ibm.biz/idt-win-installer')
```

Results:

```console
> curl -sL https://ibm.biz/idt-installer | bash
